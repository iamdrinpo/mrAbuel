**Binary Search Tree (BST) Bubble Sort**

This program lets you enter numbers, stores them in a Binary Search Tree, and then shows them sorted from smallest to largest. A Binary Search Tree is a structure where each number is stored in a "node." Each node can have a left child (smaller number) and a right child (larger number). This way, when the tree is read in order, the numbers come out sorted automatically.

**How it works**

When you give the program a list of numbers, it puts the first one as the root of the tree. Then, each new number is compared to the previous ones — smaller numbers go to the left, and bigger numbers go to the right. Finally, the program goes through the tree using “in-order traversal” and prints them in order.

**How to use**

1. Save the code as a `.py` file, for example `bst_sort.py`.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Go to the folder where you saved the file.
4. Type `python bst_sort.py` and press Enter.
5. The program will ask you to enter numbers.
6. Type the numbers separated by spaces, for example:
   `8 3 10 1 6 14`
7. Press Enter, and the program will print the numbers in ascending order.

**Requirements**:
You need Python installed on your computer. Any version from Python 3 will work, as well as a code editor (VSC or Pycharm is recommended.)
